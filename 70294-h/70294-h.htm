<p>Those who like a “white
Christmas” should see one out
on the Western plains, where
old Mother Earth lies down for her
winter sleep under a coverlet so white
that from horizon to horizon there is
hardly enough gray to outline her form.
The winds play tricks with her in scandalous
style out there, making roundness
where no roundness is and doing
their best to lay bare her very bones.
“These winds don’t care a cuss fer
clothes,” said Job Tolaver, the stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Page 10]</span>
driver, once; and John Haloran on his
hard missionary rides had thought of
it a thousand times since. He was
saying it to himself numbly now as
with stiffening fingers and head lowered
against the gale he drove along
the faint track of a road.</p>

<p>His wife threw open the door as he
drove up, and a stream of light fell
athwart the wagon. There was a barrel
in the back.</p>

<p>“Dead, John?—or only half?” Her
eager eyes searched his face. She
knew the whole pitiful story without a
word. The draft had not come. Then,
because she knew, she went on gayly,
“Or have you gone to peddling?
What’s in your barrel?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp49" id="02" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/02.jpg" alt="house">
  <figcaption class="caption">

</figure>

<p>“I don’t know yet,” he said heavily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Page 11]</span>
twisting it into the room. “We’ll see
when I’ve fed Daisy.”</p>

<p>When he was gone she eyed the barrel
curiously, tilting it and reading
aloud:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;font-size: 1.2em;margin-right: 50%;">
	<li style="text-align: center;border-top: 2px solid;border-left: 2px solid;border-right: 2px solid;">
		<span class="smcap">Rev. John F. Haloran,</span>
	</li>
	<li style="text-align: center;border-bottom: 2px solid;border-left: 2px solid;border-right: 2px solid;">
		<span class="smcap">Blue Lick, Wyoming.</span>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>“It’s not potatoes. It isn’t heavy
enough for that.” Then she struck an
attitude with clasped hands. “I never
saw one before—never! But my prophetic
soul tells me this is a missionary
barrel. And just two days before
Christmas! Well, in the language of
my first-born, ‘Hooray!’”</p>

<p>When the minister came in there
was a comfortable old coat warmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Page 12]</span>
and waiting for him, and a smoking
supper set out on a little table drawn
up before the stove.</p>

<p>“Sit down, John. I am going to
let you eat here in peace away from
the children.” He glanced up questioningly
as a roar came from the
kitchen, with snarls and growls in
various keys. “It’s all right. They
are wild animals in a cage and I am
the keeper. They are having no end
of fun. You had a cold drive.”</p>

<p>“Bitter.”</p>

<p>“You need an ulster with a storm
collar.” She glanced involuntarily at
the barrel. “Aren’t these potatoes
good, John? So mealy one hardly
needs butter. Lucky thing, too! You
didn’t know I skimped the family out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Page 13]</span>
of a pound of butter, did you? Yes,
sir, it went into the candy money.”
She meant it as a pleasantry, but
somehow it failed, and she hurried on.
“I wish there were more of the potatoes.
Those boys do eat so! But
never mind! After Christmas the hens
will begin. Funny how hens can tell
the time of the year, isn’t it?” She
chattered on about anything and
everything except the draft.</p>

<p>“This certainly is comfort,” he said
at last, relaxing under the genial influence
of food and warmth and companionship.
“That’s a cold stretch
coming out from town.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you stop anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Yes. At Joe Henderson’s. Mary—his
wife died!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Page 14]</span></p>

<p>“John!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Died last night. I never
felt so sorry for anybody in my life.
They think the baby will live; and
the poor fellow doesn’t know what to
do with it nor where to turn.”</p>

<p>“Oh, John! If only our cow weren’t
going dry I would——”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t do it, anyway,” he
said savagely. “You have enough care
now for three women!—Mary, the
draft didn’t come.”</p>

<p>“I know,” she said quietly. “But,
John, we’ll get along some way. It
can’t last forever. The draft may
come next week. And I was joking
about the potatoes. We’ve a lot left.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t just the money,” he said,
shaking his head despondently; “it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Page 15]</span>
the feeling of aloneness in the work.
If I felt that the church back of us
was doing all it could, it would not
be so hard—this ‘hope deferred that
maketh the heart sick.’ But sometimes
I think—they don’t care.”</p>

<p>“They do, John—they do! Don’t
allow yourself to think that. Why,
look at this barrel! I know this is
from some missionary society, and
would any church send us this unless
they knew about our work and were
thinking of us? Why, of course not!
Tell me about the barrel.”</p>

<p>“Well, I went to the post-office the
first thing to get the draft. I found
instead a letter from this First Church,
saying they had sent us a barrel. I
went over to the freight office and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Page 16]</span>
there it was. I didn’t have enough—”</p>

<p>“How providential that it came before
Christmas!” she interrupted.
“I’m crazy to see what’s in it! Aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>He did not answer the question directly,
being far from feeling her
jubilance about it. “We’ll open it
after a while,” he said evasively. In
his heart he was protesting, “No! I
don’t want their barrel! I want my
money!”</p>

<p>“But not until the children are off.
There will be Christmas things in it
that they mustn’t see.... You got
the candy, John? But of course you
did.”</p>

<p>Her question was unanswered, but
she did not notice it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Page 17]</span></p>

<p>“Now I really think the animals
will have to come in,” she said gayly.
“You can be trainer for an hour while
this keeper clears up the dishes.”</p>

<p>And with a whoop they were upon
him—lion, tiger, kangaroo, and baby
bear.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the children were asleep they
brought out the barrel—“our charity
box,” the minister called it, half bitterly.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it, John. It may
show an impoverished state of the
blood—or of the spirit, I don’t know
which—but when I think of all the
things these children need I am glad
of this box. I <em>am</em>—‘charity’ though
you call it! I am almost sorry you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Page 18]</span>
spent the money for candy, for of
course there will be a lot of it in
here. Well, they will have enough
for once in their lives! And they are
so starved for candy.”</p>

<p>Again he started to speak, but she
swept on in full tide of happy talk:</p>

<p>“Before we open it I want to show
you the things I already have for
them. Of course they will be poor
by comparison, so I’ll exhibit them
first. This overcoat is Paul’s, made
out of that old, old one of yours with
the plaid flannel lining. I turned the
fuzzy side out. He thinks it’s fine.
And with a new one for Paul every
overcoat in the line drops a peg and
lands on the next younger—so everybody
has a change! Then, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Page 19]</span>
pieces of plaid flannel left I made
three good mufflers to tie over their
little headies when they scud across
the prairies to school.... And here
are three pairs of mittens cut from
the scraps of the coat. I am so proud
of myself over those mittens! I had
enough yarn to knit Davie’s, but——”</p>

<p>“There isn’t one woman in a hundred
that could have managed so
well.”</p>

<p>She snuggled up to him. “That
pays me—if I needed pay, which I
don’t. It was a work of love and—well,
maybe a little necessity. You
told me once that I had a genius for
poverty.”</p>

<p>“And God knows it has had no
chance to lie dormant,” he said bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Page 20]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t want it to lie dormant. I
want every power I possess brought
out to the utmost. I truly have enjoyed
concocting these things out of
nothing. There’s nothing that makes
a woman feel so virtuous, unless it is
getting off a lot of neglected letters....
Oh, yes, here are their handkerchiefs—lovely
ones made from an old
petticoat! But it will make one thing
more for the stockings. Isn’t it glorious
that no matter how much or how
little children have at Christmas, they
enjoy it just the same? That is, if
they have candy. That is the one indispensable....
And here are the
scrapbooks. I’ve been saving pictures
all year; the blank pages are for ‘our
special artist’—that’s you. I wish I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Page 21]</span>
had some colored crayons. Oh, they
would love colored crayons! And just
think!—only ten cents!”</p>

<p>She was sorry the moment she said
it, for a shadow fell upon his face.</p>

<p>“But never mind, John,” she said
quickly. “Life isn’t made up of pinks
and greens, and neither is happiness.
You can have a whole lot of happiness
in this world in gray—if you only
know how; and I’m going to teach
these children the secret. Now look
at my eatables. It is great fun to
make a cookie menagerie with one cutter,
and that a rabbit. You see, I
stick on a trunk, pull down his ears,
round him up a bit, and behold an elephant!
Then when I want a camel I
give Br’er Rabbit two humps, stretch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Page 22]</span>
out his jaws, give him a jab almost
anywhere—and there’s your camel!
And look at my dachshund. I laughed
till I cried over that. Poor Davie was
<em>so</em> distressed when I stretched him out.</p>

<p>“And here’s a nice red apple for
each one. Poor Mary Henderson gave
them to me the last time I was over
there and I’ve been saving them ever
since. They are a little specked, but
I think they will hold out. I did want
the oranges, but ... no, of course
you couldn’t when the draft didn’t
come. Anyway, with the candy they
won’t miss other things. I have the
bags all ready—red tarlatan from a
peach basket—see?</p>

<p>“There’s just one thing I can’t get
around. I do want something to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Page 23]</span>
the house a Christmas look. I miss
that. And there’s not a thing here
but sagebrush. At home, in Maryland,
we had such quantities of holly;
and we always made wreaths for the
windows and had mistletoe for the
chandeliers, and a roaring fire in the
open fireplace, and—I can see those
parlors now. Those are the memories
that cling to us always, I think. I
am so sorry that our children can
never have them. I hate to think of
their lives being utterly devoid of
beauty. The East has more than its
share.”</p>

<p>She was talking more to herself
than to him, being momentarily carried
off her feet, so to speak, by the
flood of recollection sweeping over her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Page 24]</span>
of the old home with its mighty oaks,
its giant elms, and the hills beyond
where Christmas trees could be had
for the cutting. The sight of his face
brought her back to the present.</p>

<p>“But fortunately Christmas is not
dependent upon holly and mistletoe,”
she said brightly. “They are only the
‘outward, visible sign.’ We will garnish
our home with love and good
cheer and contentment. After all, they
are the ‘inward, spiritual grace.’”</p>

<p>She threw up her head with a gesture
habitual to her as if defying fate
and its limitations, and his eyes followed
her as she moved about the room
putting things to rights. What a
glorious creature she was!—accepting
poverty and bareness as her portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Page 25]</span>
and yet rising above them regally;
throwing herself into his work, her own
round of toil, her children’s pleasures,
the neighborhood sorrows—all with
the same exuberance of interest and
prodigality of self! What would he
have been in his work without her, his
“missionary coadjutor,” as he called
her? She was so overflowing with vitality,
so undaunted, so alive! A thrill
passed through him at the word <em>alive</em>....
Poor Joe Henderson! Suppose—He
covered his eyes and his lips moved.</p>

<p>She was on her knees beside him
in an instant.</p>

<p>“John, what is it? What are you
saying?”</p>

<p>He took her face between his hands
and looked into her eyes. “I was saying:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Page 26]</span>
‘Bless the Lord, O my soul; and
forget not all His benefits.’”</p>

<p>“I knew you would come to it,
John. Now let’s open the barrel.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The first thing to come out was a
woman’s hat-box—a generous one.
For years Mary Haloran had worn a
small brown felt, trimmed modestly
(as became a missionary’s wife) with
two quills and a knot of velvet. The
quills were placed at varying angles
from year to year, and the velvet was
steamed annually. When it got past
that it was placed under the family
iron and “mirrored.” It always looked
respectable, but when Mrs. Haloran
saw that spacious box, a swift vision
of a black velvet hat with black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Page 27]</span>
plumes and a jet buckle—all new at
the same time—rose before her.</p>

<p>“I am glad the first thing is for
you,” John Haloran said. “You deserve
it.”</p>

<p>They laughed at her efforts to untie
it; her fingers were clumsy in her excitement.
But it was open at last.
She held up to view an old white
Leghorn covered with faded flowers.
For one moment neither of them
spoke. Then her sense of humor came
to the rescue and she burst into hysterical
laughter.</p>

<p>Putting on the hat she bowed low.
“The Reverend Mrs. Haloran, missionary
coadjutor! Well, let’s see if
we can’t find something to go with
it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Page 28]</span></p>

<p>She found it. And again her ringing
laughter pealed out while the minister
stood by, the embodiment of outraged
dignity. To him there was
nothing amusing in this sight. Somebody
has said that “for taking us over
a trying place a sense of humor is better
than the grace of God.” Humor
was but rudimentary in John Haloran
at best, and to-day it was absolutely
lacking.</p>

<p>“It is an outrage!” he said.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> an outrage, John. I grant it.
But it’s funny!”</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to give here
the contents of that barrel. It is sufficient
to say that after the first few
garments hope died.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="03" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/03.jpg" alt="gift">
  <figcaption class="caption">
	<p class="center">“AN OLD WHITE LEGHORN COVERED WITH FADED FLOWERS.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“That is all,” said Mrs. Haloran at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Page 29]</span>
last. “No, here is a dear little suit,
just right for Davie. And, John,
read this note: ‘It was my little boy’s
that is gone.’” Her overwrought
nerves gave way then. “Oh, John,”
she cried, her head on his breast, his
arms around her, “we have Davie,
anyway, if we haven’t the clothes for
him. Poor, poor mother!”</p>

<p>A moment later she was putting the
garments back.</p>

<p>“It is a disappointment,” she said,
“but we certainly will not let it spoil
our Christmas. We are no worse off,
at any rate, than we were before.
The things I have will insure the
children’s good time. The candy alone
would do that.... John, get me the
candy! I’m going to fill the bags now—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Page 30]</span>
take away the bad taste of this
barrel.”</p>

<p>The moment which John Haloran
had been dreading was upon him.</p>

<p>“Mary, I didn’t get the candy.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t get it?” she echoed blankly.</p>

<p>“No. I used the money to finish
paying freight on this barrel.”</p>

<p>“John Haloran! You <em>didn’t</em>!”</p>

<p>“There was no other way. I hadn’t
enough without.”</p>

<p>“The children’s candy money!” she
said slowly. “Money that I have been
hoarding up, five cents at a time, for
months!... Why, John, Davie has
been praying for candy!”</p>

<p>“What could I do, Mary? They
wouldn’t let me have it at the freight
office without the money. I barely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Page 31]</span>
had enough as it was. And I supposed,
of course, there would be things
in it for the children—never dreamed
of anything else.”</p>

<p>“For fifty cents,” she said as if to
herself, not heeding him, “they could
have got enough candy to satisfy
these children—and they didn’t do it!
And for one dollar they could have
given them a Christmas that they
would never have forgotten. They
<em>could</em>! One dollar at the ten-cent
store would have got them a book and
a toy apiece, and two pounds of ten
cent candy. And our children would
have thought that was a glorious
Christmas—poor little tads!”</p>

<p>She had been speaking slowly and
in a low voice. Now she said with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Page 32]</span>
sudden anger: “I know the kind of
women that sent these things. They
are the kind that go up and down
fashionable city streets saying to every
acquaintance they meet: ‘Do tell me
what to get for my boy! He has
everything in the world you can think
of now!’... And I would be satisfied
with one dollar for my four! Then
after Christmas they groan: ‘What
<em>shall</em> I do with all these things?’...
And I would be glad to pick up
after mine all Christmas week if they
only had something to throw around!
There’s nothing right nor fair about
it! Now!”</p>

<p>This mood was so new to her that
her husband was speechless before it.</p>

<p>“Well! this barrel is going back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Page 33]</span>
them—to-morrow. To think of their
expecting us to pay freight on the
wretched thing!”</p>

<p>“Mary! You wouldn’t do that!”</p>

<p>“I would—and shall! I’m going to
give these people one lesson in giving
that they won’t forget! A Christmas
box for a lot of children out on the
plains and no candy in it! And Davie
praying for candy!... Well! he’s
going to have it. I’ll take this barrel
back to town to-morrow myself; and
when I come back I shall have the
candy.”</p>

<p>“Wife, you know I would be only
too glad to give you the money if I
had it. But I have only two cents left
in my pocket until the draft comes!...
Are you going to ask credit?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Page 34]</span>
Asking credit was the one humiliation
they had spared themselves.</p>

<p>“No. I am going to pay money for
it—good money—but I am going to
have it!”</p>

<p>In all their life together he had
never seen her like this. He watched
her with fascinated eyes. Going to the
mantel, she took down a box with a
slit in the top. It was their missionary
bank and was held as sacred from
profaning touch as the ark of the
Lord. She was tearing it open.</p>

<p>“Mary!” he cried, aghast. “Not the
missionary money! You wouldn’t take
that! ‘Will a man rob God?’”</p>

<p>“I’d rob anybody!” she said, turning
upon him like a lioness defending
her young. “I’m going to have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Page 35]</span>
Christmas for my children with candy
in it if the heathen go—to perdition!”</p>

<p>He saw then that she was past talking
to.</p>

</div>

<p>It was about two weeks after this
that the pastor of the First
Church called a meeting of the
ladies of the congregation to take action
about a missionary box.</p>

<p>“Another!” groaned several ladies
who never contributed.</p>

<p>He went on to explain that a barrel
sent from the church a few weeks before
had been returned, and then—not
scorning to make appeal to any God-given
attribute of the female mind—added:
“Perhaps I should say that this
barrel has been not only returned but
refused. Since it was sent from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Page 38]</span>
church it is a matter in which you are
all interested. The president of the
Missionary Society requests a full attendance.”</p>

<p>Naturally she got it. Seldom in the
annals of the First Church had there
been such a meeting.</p>

<p>“Ladies,”—the president’s tap broke
upon a lively hum,—“we are called
upon to face a most unprecedented
state of affairs. As the meeting to-day
is so much larger than the usual attendance
at our Missionary Society—so
very much in excess of the one that
launched this enterprise”—there was
marked irony in the implication—“I
feel called upon to explain. At our
October meeting it was decided to send
a box to a poor minister’s family in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Page 39]</span>
the West, and you were all urged to
contribute as liberally as possible. You
will remember that the call was one
given from the pulpit to the entire
church. How you responded to that
call we shall soon see.”</p>

<p>There was a startled movement,
quickly controlled, in several quarters.</p>

<p>“I was called from the city in November
and placed the packing of the
box in the hands of another.”</p>

<p>There was a slight stir in the second
row, but Mrs. McArthur raised a protesting
hand.</p>

<p>“One moment, please. The barrel
was sent out as a Christmas offering
from the First Church—not the Missionary
Society, mind you, but our
wealthy First Church. It was returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Page 40]</span>
immediately. With it came
this letter, which I will now read, since
it concerns you all.”</p>

<p>The president of the Missionary Society
was generously sharing honors
with the church.</p>

<p>“This is from the wife of the missionary
to whom the box was sent—Mrs.
Mary C. Haloran. I do not
know Mrs. Haloran personally, but I
am told by a lady of this congregation
at whose suggestion the box was
sent that she is a cultivated Christian
<em>lady</em>. They have a family of four
boys, ranging in age from five to
eleven. This I ascertained definitely,
in order that there might be no
haphazard, misfit giving. I left that
paper with one of our members.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Page 41]</span></p>

<p>She looked the assemblage over interrogatively
and a lady rose with evident
reluctance.</p>

<p>“Madam President—I am ashamed
to acknowledge it, but that paper was
never sent to the Society. I simply
forgot it.”</p>

<p>The president shook her head sadly.
“It has placed us in a mortifying position.
I am sure Mrs. Woodley will
pardon me for saying that it exemplifies
the truth of the old saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Evil is wrought by want of thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As well as by want of heart.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Woodley sat down with a very
red face.</p>

<p>“The evil in this case you will see
from Mrs. Haloran’s letter, which I
will now read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Page 42]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:</p>

<p>“The barrel so generously sent by
the First Church is received and its
contents are carefully noted. I find
after prayerful consideration of our
wardrobes that we really are not in
need of the articles contained in it,
and I return it thus promptly that it
may be used in discharging the obligations
of the First Church to some of
its other missionaries. If sent to the
right place—say to a self-respecting
minister with a wife whose spirit has
not been entirely crushed out by the
burdens of frontier life—I should think
it might be used several times for this
purpose.</p>

<p>“I add a small contribution in the
shape of Scripture texts, which will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Page 43]</span>
enhance the value of your gifts. The
home missionary is so accustomed to
subsisting on the Word of God that
he may be able to feed on these and
be filled. Likewise, they may have
the effect to clothe him with the garment
of praise. It is perhaps not too
much to hope that they may also do
good (incidentally) to them that are
of the household of faith in the First
Church. To this end I will ask that
they be read to the ladies of your Society
while an inventory of the barrel
is taken.</p>

<p class="right" style="margin-right: 5em;margin-bottom: .1em;">
	“Very sincerely yours,
</p>

<p class="right" style="margin-top: .1em;">
	“<span class="smcap">Mary C. Haloran</span>.”
</p>

</div>

<p>“That’s a spicy letter,” whispered
one woman to another with a sparkle
of appreciation. “The woman’s no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Page 44]</span>
fool—if she <em>did</em> go into Home Mission
work.”</p>

<p>“Madam President,” said one a little
more obtuse, “that is a very singular
communication. It doesn’t tell us
at all why the barrel was returned.”</p>

<p>“The barrel will explain itself,” returned
the president, grimly, “and
will also interpret the letter. We will
do exactly as Mrs. Haloran requests—take
an inventory and listen to the
Scripture messages. The secretary will
read.”</p>

<p>Then a most unprecedented thing
(for a Missionary meeting) occurred.
The ladies in the back part of the
room came forward.</p>

<p>The president drew from the barrel
the same promising hat-box that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Page 45]</span>
have seen, and the women craned their
necks. Black velvet and plumes flitted
through their brains too, as for one
blissful moment they had through the
mind of the woman on the plains.
Mrs. McArthur handed a slip of paper
to her assistant and held up to the
astonished gaze of her audience—the
old Leghorn.</p>

<p>“‘God loveth a cheerful giver,’”
read Mrs. Wellman.</p>

<p>There was a burst of laughter in
which the donor joined—but with dry
lips.</p>

<p>A second box was drawn forth. It
elicited another laugh, somewhat less
spontaneous than the first, for it was
a child’s summer hat trimmed with
forget-me-nots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Page 46]</span></p>

<p>“‘He that hath pity upon the poor
lendeth unto the Lord,’” read Mrs.
Wellman, adding sarcastically: “How
many loans the Lord needs, ladies, of
this particular variety, I don’t know.
Not many, I should think.”</p>

<p>“There are others,” said the president,
unconsciously lapsing into slang,
and holding up in each hand a man’s
dust-grimed straw hat. The secretary
read tellingly:</p>

<p>“‘And the Levite that is within thy
gates; thou shalt not forsake him.’”</p>

<p>There were those who could not resist
the grim satire of this, but more
faces were indignant than smiling now,
and whispers of, “Who on earth sent
those things?” passed from one to another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Page 47]</span></p>

<p>“Sh!” said one. “Look at that, will
you?”</p>

<p>It was a relic of the past, a faded
pink cloth opera cloak with a border
of moth-eaten swan’s-down which sent
out over them a feathery cloud at the
president’s deft manipulation.</p>

<p>“‘Lay up for yourselves treasures
in Heaven,’” read Mrs. Wellman,
when the coughing incident to floating
down had subsided, “‘where neither
moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where
thieves do not break through nor
steal.’”</p>

<p>They laughed. It was not in unsanctified
human nature not to laugh
at that. But a seal-clad woman in the
fourth row, with a face aflame, looked
neither to right nor left, but straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Page 48]</span>
at the garment. She had thought
when she sent it in: “It is a nice piece
of cloth, anyway, and people like that
always know how to dye things. Or
she can use it for a baby cloak.” It
seemed monstrous to her now.</p>

<p>“Madam President,” said an indignant
voice, “is there nothing in that
barrel fit to wear?”</p>

<p>The president held up two beautiful
little winter dresses. “Yes. There
are these. And some really nice baby
clothes—for Mrs. Haloran’s boys!
The need of a missionary census,
ladies, before sending out a box is
self-evident.”</p>

<p>She looked in the direction of the
recreant Mrs. Woodley, who murmured,
“‘Whereas I was blind, now
I see!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Page 49]</span></p>

<p>“The next is a contribution to the
minister himself.” She handed a paper
to Mrs. Wellman, who read:</p>

<p>“‘If there be a poor man of one of
thy brethren ... thou shalt open
thine hand wide unto him and shalt
surely lend him sufficient for his need.’”</p>

<p>“It ought to be a whole suit for
that,” came a stage whisper. The
president held up the offering which
was to be sufficient for the poor man’s
needs. It was a vest!</p>

<p>“Old vests!” came an outraged protest.</p>

<p>There was a disposition to lapse
into mirth when another vest was elevated,
but it died away as Malachi’s
burning words fell upon their unstopped
ears:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Page 50]</span></p>

<p>“‘Ye offer polluted bread upon
mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have
we polluted thee? In that ye say,
The table of the Lord is contemptible.’”</p>

<p>Before they had fairly caught their
breath after this there came another
broadside from the same plain-speaking
prophet. It was brought forth by
a cloth skirt of good material and not
much worn, but so spotted and soiled
that Mary Haloran, with one longing
look at its texture, had hurled it back
into the barrel.</p>

<p>“‘Ye said also, Behold, what a
weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at
it, saith the Lord of hosts; and ye
brought that which was torn, and the
lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Page 51]</span>
offering: should I accept this at your
hand? saith the Lord.’”</p>

<p>All amusement was now submerged
in a rising tide of indignation. The
First Church was beginning to realize
that it had placed itself in the position
of giving a gratuitous insult;
which was a shock, for the First
Church was well bred, if lacking in
missionary zeal. And it was an insult
that could not be laid on the narrow
shoulders of the Missionary Society.
The barrel had been sent from the
whole church. That it so poorly represented
them they began to see was
their own fault.</p>

<p>The enormity of the insult grew with
each new disclosure. The packing had
been done at a time when closets were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Page 52]</span>
being cleared out for the winter, and
their surplus contents had been neatly
bundled and dumped into the church
barrel. From its depths were now
brought forth indeed the lame, the
halt, and the blind; and with them
came texts of Scripture that elucidated
the law of sacrifice with startling clearness.
It is safe to say that never in
the whole reputable life of the First
Church had it listened to so pregnant
a sermon delivered in so few words.
And never, <em>never</em> had its understanding
been so open to receive with meekness
the engrafted word.</p>

<p>“‘And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice,
is it not evil?’” sounded the accusing
voice; “‘and if ye offer the
lame and the sick, is it not evil? Offer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Page 53]</span>
it now unto thy governor; will he be
pleased with thee, or accept thy person?
saith the Lord of hosts.’”</p>

<p>“Why, did you know that all those
things were in the Bible?” whispered
one astounded woman to another.</p>

<p>“No. But there are a lot of things
in the Bible that we never know about
till the time comes that we need them.
I have found that out.... Listen!”
For the president was speaking again.</p>

<p>“Ladies, I am glad to say that the
text I hold in my hand is the last. I
will read it myself. Mrs. Haloran
says: “I send this final word from the
Mosaic Law, and I beg that the First
Church may take it as a message from
all its representatives in the mission
field, and from Him we serve:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Page 54]</span></p>

<p>“‘Thou shalt not oppress an hired
servant that is poor and needy....
At his day thou shalt give him his hire,
neither shall the sun go down upon
it.” Deuteronomy xxiv. 14, 15.</p>

<p>Before Mrs. McArthur had ended
the reading the treasurer was on her
feet.</p>

<p>“At last, ladies, in my judgment,
we have got at the root of the matter.
You will find that this minister’s salary
has not been paid him; now mark
my words! And his wife is smarting
under a sense of injustice that we
should try to supply that deficiency
with a barrel of rags.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should like to know why
it hasn’t been paid,” said a well-groomed
woman, with some severity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Page 55]</span>
“What do we have a Board for if it
isn’t to attend to such things?”</p>

<p>“The Board,” explained the treasurer
with alarming succinctness, “is
our agent for disbursing the funds of
this church—and others. It cannot
honestly pay out what we have not
paid in. If you really want to know
why this man’s salary has not been
paid, I will read the delinquent list of
this church. Is there a call?”</p>

<p>There was none.</p>

<p>The president tapped. “Ladies, I
have not finished the note. Mrs. Haloran
continues:</p>

<p>“‘I return the barrel as it was sent,
with one exception. In it I found a
little half-worn suit with these words
pinned to it:’”—a sad-eyed woman in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Page 56]</span>
black, who had been listening with
strained attention, dropped her face
in her hands—“‘It was my little boy’s
that is gone.’ I cried over that little
suit. I knew what it cost her to send
it. And I accept it as from a sister
of the blood. May God bless her and
comfort her sad heart.’”</p>

<p>A tearful silence fell upon them
then, for, however callous women’s
hearts may be, there is always one
string that vibrates at the thought of
the little suit no longer needed.</p>

<p>“Ladies, I have here another letter
from Mrs. Haloran, written the next
day. She says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>:</p>

<p>“After a night of self-abasement I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Page 57]</span>
write to tell you how deeply I regret
my action of yesterday and how gladly
I would recall it if I could. I cannot
yet bring myself to feel that I should
have kept the things, but this was an
ignoble use to make of the blessed
Word of God, and I am filled with
sorrow that I should have done it. I
will only say in palliation that my husband’s
salary has been so long overdue—’”</p>
</div>

<p>“That’s it!” exclaimed the treasurer.
“I thought so!”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘—that we have not been able to
spend anything this fall for clothing,
for we will not go in debt. We needed
everything that is warm, for it is bitter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Page 58]</span>
cold out here. You can imagine
how like a mockery the barrel seemed
to me. We had even used the children’s
candy money to finish paying
the freight.’”</p>
</div>

<p>From all over the house came shocked
exclamations of “O-h! O-h!” “The
children’s candy money!” “Shame!”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘What I did was against my husband’s
earnest wishes and entreaties.
I know now that he was right and I
was wrong; but oh, if the church at
home could only be brought to see that
what we need is not charity but honest
pay!</p>

<p class="right" style="margin-right: 5em;margin-bottom: .1em;">
	“Yours for the cause,
</p>

<p class="right" style="margin-top: .1em;">
	“<span class="smcap">Mary C. Haloran</span>.”
</p>

</div>

<p>The president laid the letter down.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Page 59]</span>
“Ladies, I never was so humiliated
in all my life! That our First
Church——”</p>

<p>“Madam President,” interrupted an
incisive voice, “I should like to know
who packed that barrel.”</p>

<p>A woman in the second row turned
upon her.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> packed that barrel.” It was as
categorical as question and answer
anent Cock Robin. “I am willing to
take my share of the blame—<em>and no
more</em>. I put into that barrel exactly
what was sent in, and—as our treasurer
has most justly remarked—a disbursing
agent can do no more.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t said that she might not
do less,” interpolated the treasurer.
“If I had been attending to that job<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Page 60]</span>
I should have packed most of those
things into the furnace—or back to the
owners.”</p>

<p>All parliamentary procedure was
now cast to the winds. They talked
when and to whom they pleased.</p>

<p>“I had no right to do anything of
the kind,” defended the packer. “And
I had no reason to assume that you
would send me trash to pack.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, too!” came a voice
from the back.</p>

<p>“I will give a word of explanation,
Madam President, and then I am
through—with this barrel and all
others.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” soothed the president;
“you’ll pack another one for us sometime
and we will do better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Page 61]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed I won’t! I am through!...
Well, as I say, I left my Christmas
work while the rest of you were
doing yours, and came down here to
pack this barrel—simply because I had
promised the president, in a weak moment,
that I would do it. I was in a
great hurry, and when I saw all these
boxes and neat-looking packages I put
them in without undoing anything. It
was not my business to pass judgment
on the things you had sent in.” Then
in answer to numerous disclaimers:
“You didn’t send them in? Well,
somebody did! Who it was I don’t
know and <em>nobody else does</em>. The sexton
doesn’t, for I asked him.” There
was a settling down from strained positions
in various parts of the room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Page 62]</span>
“When I sent off the barrel I considered
that my part was done.”</p>

<p>“As it certainly was,” said the president.
“Our thanks are due Mrs. Hall
for her work, at any rate. I feel this
particularly, since I induced her,
much against her will, to undertake it.
But the thing that I most deeply deplore,
and cannot at all understand, is
that this barrel should have been sent
out with freight unpaid. We never do
that. It is a cardinal point with Missionary
Societies that all boxes must
be prepaid. I gave my personal
check—a blank one to be filled out
as was necessary—for this very purpose.
That was my contribution.”</p>

<p>“And I have just returned it to
you,” said Mrs. Hall. “It is in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Page 63]</span>
envelope on the table. The truth of
the matter is that I forgot I had the
check until after the barrel was gone.
Anyway, it seemed to me (being new
to the work as I am) that they ought
to be willing to pay freight on a valuable
box such as I supposed this was.”</p>

<p>“Do you send off your own Christmas
gifts that way?” asked the plain-spoken
treasurer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hall sat down indignantly.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get another treasurer,”
whispered one missionary worker
to another. “Mrs. Outcault is too
blunt for any use.”</p>

<p>“She always hits the nail on the
head, though.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but she splits the wood in doing
it! I am going to Mrs. Hall’s relief....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Page 64]</span>
Madam President, I think
the lady who did our packing has entirely
vindicated herself. We may as
well own up to the truth. We were
so full of our own selfish concerns that
we gave no heed to the call for this
missionary barrel in any intelligent
way. I, for one, never thought of it
once.”</p>

<p>The lady who had forgotten to send
in the description of the minister’s
family rose with elaboration.</p>

<p>“I should like to call the lady’s attention
to the fact that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Evil is wrought by want of thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As well as by want of heart.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This sally brought forth a general
laugh, which is as good as a barrel of
oil for troubled waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Page 65]</span></p>

<p>“Well, ladies, what will you do with
the situation—and the barrel?”</p>

<p>“Madam President,”—a lady was
recognized who seldom spoke, but always
to the point,—“out of the mouth
of this barrel we stand convicted of
selfish indifference to a cause we are
in duty bound to uphold, and of base
desertion of those we have sent to the
front and have promised, as Christians,
to stand by. I move that we
send to this family a box, a real one,
that shall be worthy of this church and
commensurate with their needs.”</p>

<p>There were a dozen seconders.</p>

<p>“I am not sure that they would accept
it,” suggested the chair.</p>

<p>“Tell them this was intended for a
rummage sale,” came from the right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Page 66]</span></p>

<p>“Or the Salvation Army,” from
the left.</p>

<p>“Madam President,”—it was the
dignified lady whose cheeks had flamed
at sight of the opera cloak,—“I feel
that I, for one, have been taught a lesson
in giving that will last me the rest
of my life. I should like to say as
much to this brave woman in a note
tucked in the pocket of a warm new
cloak for herself. I think I can
make that acknowledgment so humbly
that she will accept the gift.”</p>

<p>There was a soft clapping of hands
as she sat down.</p>

<p>“That’s the right spirit, Madam
President,” said the lady who had
made the motion. “Let us frankly own
up to this spirited woman that we see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Page 67]</span>
this thing as we never saw it before,
and that we are debtors to her for the
awakening.”</p>

<p>“Madam President,”—this was the
donor of one of the vests, who was
under an abiding sense of gratitude
that nobody knew it,—“I will add to
the cloak which Mrs. Caffrey has so
generously donated a new overcoat for
the minister. I give it as a thank-offering.”
This lady’s husband had
recently recovered from a severe illness
and this was erroneously taken as
a touching allusion to that fact.</p>

<p>The bidding was lively now. The
spirit of giving had taken possession
of the First Church, and a burning
desire to set themselves right. The
secretary was kept busy taking down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Page 68]</span>
the items, for it was to be no haphazard
work this time.</p>

<p>“Madam President,”—it was the
treasurer’s voice,—“as you know, I
don’t believe in missionary boxes—they
are too often substitutes for the
salaries we owe and haven’t paid—and
I have said that I would never
contribute to one; but I’ve got to put
in five pounds of candy for those children
if my principles go to smash.”</p>

<p>There was loud and prolonged applause
from all present.</p>

<p>“Now, ladies,” said the chair, when
the shower of books, toys, sleds, skates,
etc., precipitated by this offer had subsided,
“who will volunteer to pack this
box? I foresee that it will be quite a
task.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Page 69]</span></p>

<p>Then up rose the lady who had
packed the barrel.</p>

<p>“I’ll pack the box. I said I wouldn’t,
but I will. If Mrs. Outcault’s principles
have gone to smash, it isn’t
worth while for me to try to hold
on to mine! And—I will pay the
freight myself—as a trespass-offering....
No, Madam President, I don’t
want your check.”</p>

<p>When the merriment had subsided
the treasurer took the floor.</p>

<p>“Madam President and Ladies,—I
want to give a word of warning. We
will all feel very self-righteous when
we go home; and there’s danger in it.
This box is going to be sent out in a
spasm of generosity as the barrel was
sent in a spasm of indifference. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Page 70]</span>
let me tell you that <em>nothing worth living
can be supported on spasms</em>! If
any of you see now that the time has
come to pay dollars instead of duds,
and are willing to live up to your
knowledge, hold up your pocket-books!”</p>

<p>From all over the house went up
purses and bags of silver, leather, and
